        Why I Created Learning Buddy ðŸš€
      </h1>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg max-w-full md:max-w-3xl text-gray-300">
        Throughout my school life, I had realized that collaborative learning was the key to truly enjoying 
        and understanding difficult subjects. Back in high school, the reason I loved learning was 
        because my peers and I made studying an interactive and engaging experience.

      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg max-w-full md:max-w-3xl text-gray-300 mt-4">
        I believe that the culture of collaborative learning is significantly lacking in universities currently. 
        Many students study by themselves â€” in isolation. Moreover, the opportunities to connect with like-minded learners 
        are limited. That&apos;s why I built Learning Buddy â€” to bring back the power of teamwork in education.

        This platform will help students find study partners, share knowledge, and grow together. 
        Learning is more effective and enjoyable when we do it together! ðŸŽ¯
